    <h2>Pound(lbs) to Kg</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A Pound</strong> (symbol: lb) is a unit of mass used in the imperial and US customary systems of
        measurement. The international avoirdupois pound (the common pound used today) is defined as exactly 0.45359237
        kilograms. The avoirdupois pound is equivalent to 16 avoirdupois ounces.</p>
    <p><strong>Kilogram</strong> (symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). It
        is currently defined based on the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant, h, which is equal to 6.62607015
        × 10-34 in the units of J·s, or kg·m2·s-1. The meter and the second are defined in terms of c, the speed of
        light, and cesium frequency, ΔνCs. Even though the definition of the kilogram was changed in 2019, the actual
        size of the unit remained the same. The changes were intended to improve the definitions of SI base units, not
        to actually change how the units are used throughout the world.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Convert Pound to Kilogram:</strong></p>
    <p>1 lbs = 0.45359237 kg</p>
    <p>1 kg = 2.2046226218 lbs</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>convert 15 lbs to kg:</p>
    <p>15 lbs = 15 × 0.45359237 kg = 6.80388555 kg
