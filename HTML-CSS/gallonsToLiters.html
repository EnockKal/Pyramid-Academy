    <h2>Gallons to liters</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A gallon</strong> is a unit of volume specifically regarding liquid capacity in both the US customary and
        imperial systems of measurement. The US gallon is defined as 231 cubic inches (3.785 liters). In contrast, the
        imperial gallon, which is used in the United Kingdom, Canada, and some Caribbean nations, is defined as 4.54609
        liters. In both systems, the gallon is divided into four quarts. Quarts are then divided into two pints and
        pints are divided into two cups. A cup is comprised of two gills, making one gallon equal four quarts, eight
        pints, sixteen cups, or thirty-two gills. Further differentiating the US and the imperial gallon, a US gill is
        divided into four fluid ounces, while an imperial gallon is divided into five. A US fluid ounce is therefore
        1/128 of a US gallon while an imperial fluid ounce is 1/160 of an imperial gallon.</p>
    <p><strong>A liter</strong> A liter (symbol: L) is a unit of volume that is accepted for use with the International
        System of Units (SI) but is technically not an SI unit. One liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter (dm3), 1,000
        cubic centimeters (cm3), or 1/1,000 cubic meters (m3).</p>

    <p><strong>How to convert Gallon to Liter:</strong></p>
    <p>1 gal = 3.785411784 L</p>
    <p>1 L, l = 0.2641720524 gal (US)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>convert 15 gal (US) to L</p>
    <p>15 gal (US) = 15 Ã— 3.785411784 L, l = 56.78117676 L</p>
