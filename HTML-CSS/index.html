    <p>We've all run across this problem, whether it's with cooking recipies, physics equations or simple correspondence
        from a friend from half around the globe - different unit standards make successful communication tricky, and
        can sometimes lead to hilarious and/or dangerous errors.</p>
    <p>No more! I've decided to put together a single website that can help you with converting most unit into a unit
        you understand. From the common feet to meters and gallons to liters, to more sophisticated
        measurement units like shoe and clothes sizes, I have it all here in one place. Bookmark my site - you'll be
        coming back!</p>
