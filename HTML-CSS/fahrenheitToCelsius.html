    <h2>Fahrenheit to Celsius</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Fahrenheit</strong> (symbol: °F) is a unit of temperature that was widely used prior to metrication. It
        is currently defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which water freezes, 32°F, and the boiling point of
        water, 212°F, both at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure. The interval between the freezing and boiling
        point is divided into 180 equal parts.</p>
    <p><strong>Celsius</strong> (symbol: °C) is an SI (International System of Units) derived unit of temperature. It is
        defined based on the SI unit of temperature, the kelvin. The Celsius and Kelvin scales are precisely related,
        with a one-degree change in Celsius being equal to a one degree-change in kelvin. The kelvin (and thus Celsius)
        is defined based on the Boltzmann constant, k, which equals 1.380649 × 10-23 when expressed in the unit J·K-1, a
        unit equivalent to kg·m2·s-2·K-1. The kilogram, meter, and second, are defined based on Planck's constant, h,
        the speed of light, c, and cesium frequency, ΔνCs.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:</strong></p>
    <p>C = (5/9)*(F-32)</p>
    <p>F = (9/5)*c + 32</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>convert 50 °F to: °C</p>
    <p>50 °F = (50 - 32) × 5/9 = 10 °C</p>
